# Home Assistant Blueprints

These are personal Blueprints I've put together for use in Home Assistant.

## Z-Wave JS Notification Info

Go to Developer Tools, then on the Events tab, listen to "zwave_js_value_notification" 
to learn specifics about the z-wave device. From there, the "data" JSON object can be 
used in forming Blueprints.
